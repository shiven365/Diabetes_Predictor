# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health data. The project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline from data gathering to creating a local web application with Flask.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a seamless process for predicting diabetes by building a machine learning model that analyzes various health parameters. A web application takes user input, processes it through the model, and provides an instant prediction.

## Project Objectives

The project follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Gathering**: Collected relevant medical data from public datasets.
2.  **Descriptive Analysis**: Explored the dataset to understand underlying patterns and trends.
3.  **Data Visualizations**: Created insightful visualizations to represent key relationships in the data.
4.  **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the data for use in the machine learning model.
5.  **Data Modelling**: Trained a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict diabetes.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy.
7.  **Web Application**: Built a Flask web application to serve the model and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Technical Aspects

### Machine Learning Model

* **Library**: scikit-learn
* **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests (or any chosen algorithms based on your project)
* **Input Features**: The following fields are taken from the user:
    * Number of Pregnancies
    * Insulin Level
    * Age
    * Body Mass Index (BMI)
    * Blood Pressure
    * Glucose Level
    * Skin Thickness
    * Diabetes Pedigree Function
* **Output**: The model predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes (Yes/No).
